I've put a pause on CHRONOSV2 due to a similar reason for stopping the initial version, there is just such a big barrier between trying to predict transitions and market regimes
using my limited 15 year old skill, I need to train myself with more different projects and come back when the time is right, but for now, Triple Barrel Initiation.
